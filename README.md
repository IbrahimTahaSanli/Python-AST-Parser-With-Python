# Python-AST-Parser-With-Python
 Python Abstract Syntax Tree Parser With Python? It doesnt make sense huh. For some ml project i tried to ast as input and i used some modern ml libraries which uses python. So i needed a bridge within ast parser and ml libraries or use pythons own parser. I choose third which i make a ast parser work with other modules. Which doesnt work well.
 
 It reads code Right To Bottom order. Uses regex for defining classes.
 
#CAUTION

 Currently this code works on best case scenario as show in first example. Which doesnt includes negative numbers and directories. Codes written in Python 3.7 syntax.
